            <p class="elem-txt-base txt">
                I have lived in Colombo for a few years after returning from my adventures abroad. However, nothing
                really beats the air and serenity of my home town, Ratnapura. My formative years were shaped by the
                city's natural beauty and the rivers that flow through it. It's not just a city that brings joy to me.
                It's also a vital resource of Sri Lanka.

            <p class="elem-txt-base txt">
                Ratnapura, town, southwestern Sri Lanka. It is situated southeast of Colombo, on the Kalu River.
                Dominating the town is a hill on which the Portuguese built a fort. Ratnapura (Sinhalese: “City of
                Gems”) is Sri Lanka’s chief source of precious and semiprecious stones (including rubies, sapphires, and
                cat’s-eyes), which are found in the valleys around the town and are prepared by Muslim gem cutters;
                examples are on display in the town’s gem museum. Graphite is also mined in the area. The town is
                connected with Colombo by rail and with other parts of Sri Lanka by road. Pop. (2007 est.) 48,412.

            <p class="elem-txt-base txt">
                The name 'Ratnapura' is a Sanskrit word meaning "city of gems", from the Sanskrit words pura (town) and
                ratna (gemstone).Over 2000 years ago, when the first Buddhist monks arrived here from the north eastern
                provinces of India namely Bodh-Gaya, Varanasi and Pataliputra, they not only brought with them the
                Buddhist religion, but since their teachings were mainly in Sanskrit and Pali they also influenced the
                local language. While candy produced from the jaggery palm is traditionally known in this region as
                ratnapura, it is more likely that the candy was named for the locale rather than vice versa.

                There are a number of places to visit in Ratnapura, including:

                        <b class="elem-txt-3">Maha Saman Devalaya</b> – a shrine dedicated to the god Saman. The god Saman is (a Buddhist deity)
                        considered to be the guardian of Ratnapura. When the Portuguese captured Ratnapura, the ancient
                        shrine that stood at this location was destroyed and a Portuguese church was constructed on top of it.
                        When the Kandyan kingdom recaptured Ratnapura, the Portuguese church was destroyed and the shrine was
                        rebuilt. Although there is no direct evidence to support the existence of the old shrine, indirect
                        evidence supports the existence of a shrine that looked like a Hindu temple at the current location
                        before Portuguese times. Currently this shrine is a very important place for Buddhists.

                        <b class="elem-txt-3">Saints Peter and Paul's Cathedral</b> – The history of Catholics in Ratnapura begins with Portuguese
                        rule in Ratnapura. Very few Catholics lived in the town in the 17th century. Many of them are the
                        descendants of Portuguese and locals that they married. There is evidence to suggest that the Portuguese built
                        a church on top of a destroyed Buddhist temple. That Portuguese church was destroyed when the Kandyan
                        kingdom recaptured Ratnapura from the Portuguese. The current church was built in a different location
                        along the main street of Ratnapura (inside the town). The Church building being used now is said to be
                        inspired by St. Joseph Vaz (Apostle of Ceylon) during the 17th century when he visited Ratnapura as a part
                        of his apostolic mission to Sabaragamuwa. After Sabaragamuwa became a diocese on 2 November 1995 SS.
                        Peter-Paul's Church was raised to the status of the Cathedral of the diocese.

                        Walagamba (89-77 BC) in the 1st century. It had been renovated during the days of King Kirthi Sri

                        Adam's Peak, via the Gilimale and Carney Estates. The pilgrimage season starts on Poya (full moon) day in December and runs until
                        the start of the south-west monsoon in April. It has been a pilgrimage centre for over 1,000 years.
                        King Parakramabahu and King Nissanka Malla of Polonnaruwa provided ambalamas or 'resting places' for
                        weary pilgrims along the mountain route. The other more popular route is through Dalhousie (pronounced
                        'Del-house') close to Dickoya.
